# Mersennes
A Mersenne number is any number that can be written as 2p − 1 for some p. Mersenne numbers can only be prime if their exponent, p, is prime.   

Lucas_lehmer: We can test if a Mersenne number is prime using the Lucas-Lehmer test. 
For a given Mersenne number with exponent p, the number is prime if the Lucas-Lehmer series is 0 at position p − 2.
